## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I Learned

This was a fun little project. It was cool because I discovered the `inset` rule. The `inset` rule is the shorthand property instead of using `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left`.

I had some problems with the hover effect of the NFT image, I did some research and found a good example on [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_fade) that went along way and helped me achieve the desired look. I did need to tweak the styles however to get the icon on hover to display, but it was nothing too difficult.
